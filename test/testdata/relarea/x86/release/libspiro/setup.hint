ldesc: "Spiro is the creation of Raph Levien. It simplifies the drawing 
of beautiful curves.

Using bézier splines an artist can easily draw curves with the same 
slope on either side of an on-curve point. Spiros, on the other hand, 
are based on clothoid splines which make it easy to maintain constant 
curvature as well as constant slope. Such curves will simply look nicer."
