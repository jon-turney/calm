sdesc: "Key manager for OpenSSH"
ldesc: "Keychain is an OpenSSH key manager, typically run from
~/.bash_profile. When keychain is run, it checks for a running
ssh-agent, otherwise it starts one. It saves the ssh-agent environment
variables to ~/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh, so that subsequent logins
and non-interactive shells such as cron jobs can source the file and
make passwordless ssh connections. In addition, when keychain runs, it
verifies that the key files specified on the command-line are known to
ssh-agent, otherwise it loads them, prompting you for a password if
necessary"
