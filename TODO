* per-package-version hint files (e.g. named <pvr>.hint, or /.setup.hint inside tar file)
* more than 2 versions possible (and automatically vault 'old' versions, where we have some mechanism to explicity say what is old)
* automatically mark 'empty, source only' install packages as skip to suppress from setup.ini ?
* run more often, option to not do anything if no uploads (to avoid reading the release area if we don't need to), lockfile to avoid colliding runs
* work out some way to package it as a replacement for genini
* handle .noarch packages better
* use irkerd to report when calm failed due to an error?
* leads_email should be empty unless something when wrong; warnings should always go to uploader
* mails should be sent Reply-To: cygwin-apps ?
* leads mail should indicate what reports have been sent to whom, and what reports couldn't be sent because no email address was known
* disallow -setup.hint, since it won't work correctly
* refactor maintainers, I've made a terrible hash of it
* simplify setup.hint lexer
* pkg2html needs to clean up empty directories
* uploading needs to be permissioned on base package name, not path?
