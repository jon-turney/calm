sdesc: "The ARC archive utility"
ldesc: "This program is based on the MSDOS ARC program, version 5.21, plus a
few enhancements. ARC performs Huffman Squeezing on data. The Huffman
Squeeze algorithm was removed from MSDOS ARC after version 5.12. It
turns out to be more efficient than Lempel-Ziv style compression when
compressing graphic images. Squeeze analysis is always done now, and
the best of packing, squeezing, or crunching is used."
