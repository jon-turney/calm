sdesc: "Check C programs for security vulnerabilities and programming
mistakes."
ldesc: "Program does many of the traditional lint checks including
unused declarations, type inconsistencies, use before definition,
unreachable code, ignored return values, execution paths with no
return, likely infinite loops, and fall through cases. More powerful
checks are made possible by additional information given in source
code annotations. Annotations are stylized comments that document
assumptions about functions, variables, parameters and types. In
addition to the checks specifically enabled by annotations, many of
the traditional lint checks are improved by exploiting this additional
setinformation."
