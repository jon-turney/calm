# utilities for working with a maintainer list

#
# things we know about a maintainer:
#
# - their home directory
# - the list of packages they maintain (given by cygwin-pkg-list)
# - an email address (in HOME/!email (or !mail), as we don't want to publish
#   it, and want to allow the maintainer to change it)
